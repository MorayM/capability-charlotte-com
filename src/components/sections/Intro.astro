        This year would you like to spend more time in your garden without worrying about how it looks?
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Do you basically know what you want but are struggling to visualise it?
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Well, you've come to the right place, Charlotte can help you. 
        With over two decades of experience as a hands-on gardener, garden designer and horticultural adviser for a huge variety of gardens in Wiltshire, Hampshire, Bath and Bristol, you can rest assured that Charlotte knows what she is doing.

        In these troubled times those of us lucky enough to have an outside space realise what an oasis of calm it can be.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Being in gardens and outside places can vastly improve both our mental and physical health, that's a scientific fact, but if your garden isn't working for you it can just feel like a burden. It doesnâ€™t have to be like that, Charlotte feels gardens should work for you not you for them.

      <h3>How much will it cost?</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        "It all depends" is always the answer. A good rule of thumb is to think how much you'd be willing to spend on a kitchen and that's a good starting point. Gardens aren't cheap, but Charlotte has experience of working with the tightest of budgets. 
        A well-designed garden is a great investment, it can vastly improve both your quality of life and the value of your home.
