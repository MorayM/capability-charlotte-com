			<h3>Affordable &ldquo;No-Frills&rdquo; Garden Advice Service &mdash; In-Person or Online</h3>
			<p class="lead">
				Looking for expert garden advice without the designer price tag? My No-Frills Garden 
				Advice Service is a one-hour consultation for garden owners or custodians who want 
				honest, practical guidance on a budget.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				Whether you&rsquo;re overwhelmed by a new garden, struggling to make sense of an inherited 
				layout, or just want low-cost help getting started, this is a great option. I&rsquo;ll walk 
				through your garden with you (or connect via video call), and give you tailored, no-jargon 
				advice on planting, layout, and what to tackle first. You bring a notepad &mdash; I&rsquo;ll 
				bring 20 years of experience.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				Cost: £100 per hour.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				Location: In-person within 30 miles of my home (travel expenses apply beyond that), or 
				anywhere via online garden consultation at reduced rate of £70 per hour.
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
				Clients often use this as a starting point before taking on a full garden redesign, or 
				simply as a confidence boost to tackle things themselves.

	<h3>Indoor Gardening</h3>
	<div class="columns">
		<div class="col one-half">
			<p class="lead">Human beings have an innate connection to nature. Studies have shown time and time again
			that being able to view nature, whether through a window or via indoor plants improves our mental and
			physical health. Nowadays more than any other, people need nature. Many people don&rsquo;t have the luxury of
			a garden or pets, with house plants you can take care of a living thing. I can help you choose
			the perfect house plants in conjunction with bespoke terrarium maker <a
				target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/TerrachicUK/" title="Terrachic of Bath">Terrachic of Bath</a>.</p>
			<p class="lead">For businesses, indoor plants have been shown to help reduce sickness and boost energy and
				creativity amongst their workforce. I can show you how a living wall can create impact, clear
				pollution and save energy in your workspace.</p>

	<h3>Plant Styling</h3>
	<p class="lead">
		Do you have a wedding, funeral or special occasion that needs some original and eco-friendly plant styling? 
		Rather than using cut flowers, why not fill your space with plants in pots which you can then plant in your 
		garden or give to friends as a memory of a special day or poignant moment?
	</p>
	<p class="lead">
		I can work with you to design you a magical space and am happy to collaborate with local florists 
		and the venue to give you a full package.
