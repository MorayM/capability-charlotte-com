April is when the garden starts to really come to life. The days are longer, the soil is
warming, and everything seems to be growing at once—including the weeds! It’s the perfect
time to get outside, whether you’re planting, pruning, or simply soaking in the spring
energy. This is you last chance to split congested perennials.

## Planting for the Season

April is ideal for sowing hardy annuals like calendula, cornflowers, and nigella directly into
the soil. Sweetpeas can be sown at the base of supports. If you’re growing vegetables, get
carrots, beetroot, and chard in the ground, and if you’re lucky enough to have space for
potatoes, now’s the time to plant them. Tender crops like courgettes and beans can be
started under cover, ready for planting out in late May.

## Wildlife Matters

Your local wildlife is waking up too. Bees are buzzing, birds are nesting, and hedgehogs are
emerging from hibernation. Avoid cutting back early spring flowers just yet, primroses and
forget-me-nots are vital nectar sources, but do dead head as letting them go to seed can
weaken growth. If you can, leave a few dandelions; they’re a lifeline for pollinators. Pon
plants can now be added to ponds.

## Jobs for Now

* Mulch borders to keep moisture in and suppress weeds.
* Weed regularly—they’re much easier to deal with while small.
* Prune spring-flowering shrubs like forsythia once they’ve finished blooming.
* Feed hungry plants like roses and clematis with an organic fertilizer.

April is full of promise, energy, and change. I’ve always thought it’s the best month to be a
gardener!
