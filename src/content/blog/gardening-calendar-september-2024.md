September marks the transition from summer to autumn, making it a busy month for gardeners. As temperatures drop and daylight hours shorten, there are plenty of gardening tasks to keep you occupied.

### Lawn Care
Revitalize your lawn. Scarify the grass to remove thatch, aerate to improve drainage, and apply autumn feed to prepare it for the colder months.

### Planting
Plant spring bulbs like daffodils, crocuses, and tulips. It's also ideal for planting perennials and shrubs, giving them time to establish before winter. Consider adding winter pansies and violas for autumn colour.

### Harvesting
Pick the last of your tomatoes, beans, and courgettes. Early autumn fruits like apples, pears, and plums are also ready to be gathered. Elderberries should be ready to forage and make a great cordial to fend off winter colds, pick Sloe berries for Sloe gin. Remember to leave plenty for the birds.

### Pruning and Tidying
Prune late-flowering shrubs, deadhead roses, and clear away any faded annuals. This tidying prevents diseases and pests from overwintering in your garden.

### Mulch
Add the first layer of mulch to feed the soil and help control weeds, any organic mulch is fine just make sure manure is well rotted.
