In December, none of us feel like being in the garden, hopefully all your tender plants are tucked up warm and cosy and your beds have a nice, thick layer of mulch. If so, I thought I would give you a nice project to do, using cuttings from your garden by creating an eco-friendly Christmas wreath. By using materials from your garden, you can make a beautiful, sustainable decoration with a personal touch.

## Gather Your Materials

Start by collecting evergreen branches, such as holly or, pine for the base, youâ€™ll need more than you think. Look for natural embellishments like pinecones, berries, seed pods, dried flowers or even feathers. For a splash of colour, include sprigs of rosemary, lavender, or eucalyptus if you have them.

## Build the Frame

You can create a base by bending flexible branches, like willow or dogwood, into a circle and securing them with twine. Alternatively, reuse an old wreath frame if you have one. Avoid foam or plastic bases to keep your wreath eco-friendly.

## Assemble the Wreath

Layer the greenery around the frame, securing each piece with natural twine or biodegradable floral wire. Overlap the stems to create a full, lush effect. Add your decorative elements, like berries and pinecones, ensuring they are evenly spaced for balance. Think about doing things in threes.

## Add the Finishing Touch

For hanging, use a ribbon made of natural fibre or repurpose strips of fabric. Avoid synthetic ribbons or glittery decorations. This handmade wreath not only celebrates the beauty of nature but also fosters sustainability. Plus, it can be composted after the festive season, leaving no waste behind. Happy crafting!
