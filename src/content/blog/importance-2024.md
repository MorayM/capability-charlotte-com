In September, I had the privilege of producing The Importance of Being Earnest at the stunning West Lavington Manor, under the talented direction of Dusty Limits. This classic Oscar Wilde play, known for its witty dialogue and biting satire, came to life in the great hall in the first act .The manor's gardens provided a picturesque backdrop for Act 2, enhancing the performance’s timeless appeal and literally immersing the audience in this intimate production.

Nearly a year ago, I sat down with Jordina and Andrew Evins, owners of the stunning West Lavington Manor, to discuss a rather bold idea. During a wander through their beautiful garden, I suggested we collaborate to stage a play with my theatre company, The Old Bag Theatre Company. I proposed The Importance of Being Earnest, a classic comedy that I knew would amuse audiences and suit the Manor's picturesque setting. Jordina and Andrew, with their infectious enthusiasm and love for sharing their garden with people, were immediately on board.

Fast forward to 8th September, we had a sell-out show and the grounds of West Lavington Manor had become a vibrant place of entertainment, people brought picnics and drank champagne while exploring the gardens. Dusty Limits aided by their hugely talented cast brought their signature flair to the production, combining traditional elements of the play with modern twists that kept it fresh and engaging. The intimate settings and limited audience made the experience feel very special, and the audience’s laughter and applause echoed through the great hall and gardens, reminding us all of the joy live theatre can bring.

We had a larger goal in mind: raising money for The Nestling Trust, a charity close to our hearts. Through bar and ticket sales and donations, we raised £550 for their work in Nepal, providing essential healthcare and education.

This production was a special blend of artistic expression and community spirit, and I’m hugely grateful to Jordina and Andrew who so generously allowed us to invade their beautiful home and heartfelt thanks to the cast and volunteers who gave up their time, for free, to support both the performance and The Nestling Trust. Looking back, it’s hard to believe this all started with a casual chat in a garden, we’re already dreaming up our next production, watch this space…
