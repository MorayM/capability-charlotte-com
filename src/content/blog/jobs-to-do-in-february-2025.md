# February Gardening Jobs

February marks the transition between winter&apos;s dormancy and spring. While frosty mornings are still
common, this is a good time to prepare your garden for the warmer months ahead.

## Pruning and Tidying

Prune summer-flowering shrubs such as roses, wisteria, and buddleia to shape them and encourage
healthy growth. Remove any dead, damaged, or diseased branches from trees and shrubs. Leave the
leaves on the borders and hold fire on cutting back your perennials, they are still providing a habitat
for insects. Right now I’m watching blue tit eat the seeds off my Verbena bonariensis

## Soil Preparation

Preparing your soil is key to a productive growing season. Remove weeds, and add well-rotted
compost or manure to improve fertility and structure. Avoid working on the soil if it’s waterlogged,
and when dry use a plank to spread your weight on the soil to avoid compaction. If you have raised
beds, cover them with fleece or cloches to warm the soil in preparation for planting.

## Early Planting and Sowing

Sow hardy seeds such as sweet peas, broad beans, and early lettuces indoors. Bare-root plants,
including roses and fruit trees, can be planted now while they’re dormant. February is also ideal for
dividing snowdrops &ldquo;in the green&rdquo; after they finish flowering.

## Lawn Care

Lightly rake lawns on dry days to remove debris and prepare them for the growing season. Avoid
mowing until the grass starts growing steadily.
By tackling these tasks, you’ll give your garden a head start before it kicks off in spring.
