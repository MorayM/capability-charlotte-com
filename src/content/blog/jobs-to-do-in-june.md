As we approach the longest day, June is the true start of summer “Ne’er cast a clout ‘til May
is out” which means all risk of frost has passed and you can finally put out your tender plants
and your hanging baskets.

I like to give my houseplants a little garden holiday especially on a rainy day, put them
somewhere shady and protected, strong sun can be a bit of shock for them.
The quote “June is busting out all over!”, always amuses me because June is a difficult
month for flowers. The spring flowers are over and the summer flowers are only just getting
going. The only things that seem to be ‘busting’ in June are the weeds, keep on top of them
with hoeing and mulching, yes, you can mulch any time of the year.

Start to pinch out the side shoots of your tomatoes to stop them getting too bushy, these are
the little shoots that sprout above each leaf.

Keep your plants deadheaded to encourage repeat flowering.

Step up your watering regime especially with pots and newly-planted plants. Be water-wise
and use water harvested from your house and shed roofs, water in the morning or evening
when it is cooler and less likely to evaporate. It is better to give plants a good drench once a
week than a little dribble every day, this encourages strong, deep roots.
Keep a low bowl of water out for birds and hedgehogs, add marbles to it so bees can also
drink from it.

Shade greenhouses to keep them cool.

Cut back any leggy looking perennials by about a third, this is called the Chelsea Chop. This
will delay flowering and encourage side shoots giving a fuller appearance.

Stake plants like peonies that are likely to flop.
