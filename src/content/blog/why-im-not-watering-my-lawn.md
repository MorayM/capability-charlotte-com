I’m sure we are all noticing how dry it is the soil is already cracking in places, seedlings are stalling, and the plants in my garden are telling me this spring was too dry, too soon.

Spring bulbs like tulips and daffodils have come and gone in a flash and perennials are shooting up quickly, but not necessarily in a good way. When they grow fast in dry soil, their root systems don’t develop properly and that leaves them vulnerable. The warm weather pushed them on too fast, and instead of a long, gentle flowering period, it’s all felt a bit rushed. Pollinators are now struggling to find sources of nectar.

Dry soil means fewer worms and fewer insects, which has a knock-on effect up the food chain.

We’re seeing a pattern now: wet winters followed by dry, early springs. Climate change isn’t some far-off thing, it’s here, reshaping our growing conditions right now.

Here are a few simple steps that make a real difference:

- Mulch your beds – Compost, bark, whatever you’ve got. It keeps the moisture in and protects plant roots from temperature swings.
- Water at the right time – early morning or evening is best.
- Choose your battles – don’t try to keep everything lush. Focus on what really matters: food crops, new plantings, and wildlife-supporting flowers.
- Don’t water your lawn - Lawns are tougher than they look. They’ll turn brown and become dormant when it’s dry and bounce back when the rain comes.
- Choose the Right Plant – Choose resilient plant that can tolerate both wet and dry conditions such as: Ferns, Irises, Astilbe, Geum, Salvia guaranitica, Canna, Roses, Hylotelephium, Hardy Geraniums, Verbena Bonariensis.
- Plant in Autumn – To give plants a chance to set down deep roots while the soil is moist.

It’s time to stop chasing the idea of a perfect, high-maintenance garden and start building something more resilient. That doesn’t mean giving up beauty, quite the opposite. It means choosing plants that thrive in your conditions, improving soil health, and thinking long-term.
